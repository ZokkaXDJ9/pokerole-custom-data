Initiative Phase:\n- Roll initiative with `1d6 + Dexterity` to determine turn order.\n- Mention if using a move with Priority; higher priority moves act first.\n- Players may be moved to the end of the turn order if they take too long.\n### 2. Combat Phase:\n- On your turn, interact with one item from your backpack (e.g., use a berry or switch held item).\n- Describe your character's action and use `/move` to post it.\n### 3. Rolling for Accuracy:\n- Roll the number of dice specified by the move for accuracy.\n- Rolls of 4-6 are successes; at least one success is needed to hit.\n- Rolling three 6s results in a critical hit.\n### 4. Rolling for Damage:\n- Roll dice based on your move’s damage formula.\n- Each success (4-6) inflicts 1 damage.\n- STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) and super effectiveness add +1 damage each, double effectiveness adds +2 damage.\n- Critical hits boost your total damage after calculation by an additional x1.5 (rounding up).\n### 5. Chance Dice for Status Effects:\n- Roll for each status effect as specified; only 6s trigger effects.\n### 6. Minimum Damage Based on Type Effectiveness:\n- **Double Effective**: Minimum 3 damage.\n- **Super Effective**: Minimum 2 damage.\n- **Neutral**: Minimum 1 damage.\n- **Resisted/Lower**: Minimum 0 damage.",
